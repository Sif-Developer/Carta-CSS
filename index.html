                At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects fall<br>
                somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just<br>
                the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued<br>
                by are as follows, in order of priority:<br>
            </p>
                <div class="box">
                    <ol>
                        <li class="box" class="description">1. Turning H2O into wine, and the health benefits of Rcsveratrol (C14H12O3.)</li>
                        <li class="box" class="description">2. Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplaycrs at tcmpraturcs

            <p class="text">
                So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long youd expect<br>
                the research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.

        Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work. I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question,<br>
        my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:<br>

                        <dd class="description">Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which<br>
                    involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in impcrccptably<br>
                    tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired<br>
                    modem styles such as Twerking</dd>
